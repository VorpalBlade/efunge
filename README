efunge
======
This is a simple Befunge-93 interpreter coded in what I aim to make idiomatic
Erlang. As this is my first "real" Erlang project I'm sure there are lot of
code that is done the wrong way.

To run this you will need to have Erlang installed and erlc in your PATH.
You will also need make to build the project (or you could use c() in erl).

Building instructions:
* Run "make" (without the quotes) in your shell while you are in the efunge
  directory.

Running instructions:
* Run "erl" (without the quotes) in your shell while you are in the efunge
  directory.
* Run:
    efunge:start("path/to/befunge/program.bf").
  Note that the dot after the statement is important, do not try to use a
  semi-colon or such, just use a dot.
* Enjoy the program
* To exit the Erlang shell run:
    q().
  Again use a dot at the end, not something else.


Known bugs and limitations:
* I have not yet found out how to make starting from a shell script work.
* It will print "quit" at the end of the program, this is because every function
  in erlang must have a value, and the shell will print that value at exit.
  Only way to fix it, is by starting from a shell script.
* Input is kind of buggy currently.
* It is slow, but that will not be fixed, if you want a fast Befunge interpreter
  try cfunge (http://rage.kuonet.org/~anmaster/cfunge/) that is coded in C.
  It also handles Funge-98 and Funge-108.
  However, cfunge only works on POSIX platforms.
