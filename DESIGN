This file details design for the 98 version of efunge:

Modules:
* efunge         - Handles command line arguments only.
* fstack         - Funge stack.
* fstackstack    - Funge stack-stack.
* fspace         - Funge space.
* finput         - STDIO in the Funge way. Can be used from fingerprints too.
* fip            - IP functions, like reverse, also things like getting and
                   setting fingerprint specific data. IP specific state.
* finterpreter   - Handle core instructions, loops over IP. Also global shared
                   state.
* fsysinfo       - Implements y.
* ffingerstack   - Implements fingerprint instruction stacks.
* ffingerindex   - Looks up loading fun for a fingerprint. Used from manager.
* ffingermanager - Handle the details of finding fingerprints, opcode stacks.
* fingerprints/  - Fingerprints should be in a subdirectory. One per file.


Process dictionary:
The process dictionary got one single use: place to put the cmd line arguments.
